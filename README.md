# Problem solving practice in python

Here I am adding some basic problem of python code

To save work and save git files in local directory, make a directory first(if want to create a new one)
1. `pwd`
2. `mkdir Directory_Name`  // any directory name
3. type `ls` to check it is created or not
4. type `cd Directory_Name` to move inside the directory. 

## Git workflow for beginners

1. to access git into local created directory, type command in local pc's terminal and copy the url from the git website: `git clone url`
1. type `git status` after cloning

1. To add file in git --> `git add filename.extension`

1. Type `git status`

1. To commit file in git --> type `git commit -m "message"`
1. To upload the changes from local to remote type `git push`.
